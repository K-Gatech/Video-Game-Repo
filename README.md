Celestials is a game I created with four other members in 2022 for CS6457 Video Game Design.

In the game, you play as an alien searching for a new home. It features shooting elements, puzzle-solving, and exploration across three different levels.

To play the game, you will need to download the files and build it in Unity. If you would like me to send you the game to try out, please let me know.
